Neon signs are glass tubes that may be coated with rich earth minerals. The tubes are filled with gas and electrified.

## Tubes

Glass tubes range in size. Common sizes include 12mm {{ need more detail, why use thick vs thin }}

## Creating a design

A design should be created using a vector graphics computer program.

## Steps of making a neon

* Design the sign.
* Create a vector graphic.
* Think about how it will be bent.
* Add bending instructions to the vector graphic.
* Picking a tube size and color.
* Bend it.
* Splice the electrodes on.
* Fill with gas.
* Age the gas.
* Hook up to a transformer.
* Mount it.


## Unmerged Notes

When a tube is bent properly, connect electrodes on either end.

Always use the first bend as the ref point to even out mistakes
