## Splicing electrodes

Place a rubber hose on the end of the electrode, and a cork on the other end of the tube. This will create a vacuum so we can splice the electrode to the tube. Put the electrode and the tube end into the crossfire. Rotate the electrode. When both are hot stick them together and take them out of the fire. Blow a little air into the tube and stretch the tube out while sucking in the air. Flash the splice by putting it back in the fire a little ways down from the splice and moving it across the splice.
