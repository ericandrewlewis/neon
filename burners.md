## Burners

Natural gas burners heat the glass for bends.

The ribbon burner is a strip (or ribbon) of variable length to heat a length of tube. Good for long bends.

The crossfire burner consists of two torches aimed at each other. Good for tight bends and splicing tubes together.

The hand torch is used for small-length precision heating for splices.

A burner has an air and gas line coming into it. To light a burner, turn on the air. Light a lighter, and put it near the output. Then turn up the gas until it catches.
