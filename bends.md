## The right angle bend

Mark the tube with chalk at the center of the bend, and on either side of the center about one diameter away. The two outer marks are the edges of the bend.

Stick a cork in one end of the tube and put a rubber blowhose on the other. Put the blowhose in your mouth, which you'll use to blow and expand the glass after bending it tightens it up. Don't close your mouth on the rubber until you're blowing. You can hold it between your teeth with your mouth open. Closing your mouth will create a vacuum and unintentionally blow air while the glass is heated.

Hold the glass with palms up. As you'll be bending the ends of the glass up, bringing your hands together, this is a natural grasp.

The side of the glass that faces the floor will be the outer side of the bend.

Put the glass in a crossfire burner. Move it back and forth between the outer chalk marks.

When the glass softens, you'll need to control either end of the tube independently. Move both ends in sync, and keep the tube straight at the proposed bend.

Bring the tube up just before the bend, heating just the outer side of the bend (that faces the floor). Bring it out of the fire completely.

Make the bend, bringing arms upwards and towards each other. After the bend has been completed, blow until the bend is a good shape.

If you have a design, throw the tube onto it and adjust accordingly.

## The double back bend

A double back is a bend that reverses the direction of the tube 180°.

Mark the tube with chalk at the center of the bend, and on either side of the center about 1.5 diameters away. The two outer marks are the edges of the bend.

## Wide bend

When working with a tube on the ribbon burner, place the tube straight down into the fire and rotate it 180º every second.

## The drop
